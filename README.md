##1. Source codes: There are two folders in the source codes. The main entry is test_segments.m under the time_series folder. The codes under the supervised_feature_selection path are NetRLS model and APG algorithm. The codes under the time_series path are the shapelets learning codes with NetRLS algorithm. We put some test data in the codes, and researchers can upload the datasets with read_data() function.

##2. Data: There are three data sets in this folder. One is the DBLP data, one is the Twitter data and one is the Weibo data. Each data folder includes network matrix (matrix_network.dat), labels matrix (matrix_Y.dat), and time series matrix (matrix_TS.dat).

##3. Crawler codes: Since the data from Twitter, DBLP and Weibo were obtained by our own crawler codes, we also publish the crawler codes of the Twitter and the DBLP data sets.
